A simple template for making <i>tactical role-playing games</i> on [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/).
This is not a fully functional game framework or a professional work, just a simple project made in my free time. 
Anyways, feel free to use this sample in your own game. 

- You can see all project's features on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ov4zGUp68).
- Another demo from [Open Source Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AY6KEdX_3E).
- In case you are searching for some 2d projects, checkout [GDQuest](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-2d-tactical-rpg-movement) or [TBS_GoDot](https://github.com/ja-brouil/TBS_GoDot)
