A simple template for making <i>tactical role-playing games</i> on [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
This is not a fully functional game framework or a professional work, just a simple project made in my free time. 
Anyways, feel free to use this sample in your own game. 

You can see all project's features on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0ov4zGUp68).<br/>
Another demo from [Open Source Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AY6KEdX_3E).
