## Tactical RPG for Godot Engine

A simple template for making <i>tactical role-playing games</i> on [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
This is not a fully functional game framework or a professional work, just a simple project made in my free time. 
Anyways, feel free to use this sample in your own game.
